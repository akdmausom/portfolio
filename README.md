# Arijit Kumar Das Portfolio 

I chose react for develop fronent and i add tailwind css library, and daisyUI it is a customizable Tailwind CSS component library. I hope i intruduce some more library and packages to make this portfolio looks better. Don't worry. In this markdown file i'll tell you whole thing how many packages i used to build this portfolio site.

### Which package manager i use for this project?

- I chose `yarn` because it's faster & secure then node package manager. Install [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable "Click and install yarn")

- I add `react-helmet-async `package for changing title for every page.
